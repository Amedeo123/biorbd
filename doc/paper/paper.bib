  abstract = {The proposition that dynamic optimization provides better estimates of muscle forces during gait than static optimization is examined by comparing a dynamic solution with two static solutions. A 23-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model actuated by 54 Hill-type musculotendon units was used to simulate one cycle of normal gait. The dynamic problem was to find the muscle excitations which minimized metabolic energy per unit distance traveled, and which produced a repeatable gait cycle. In the dynamic problem, activation dynamics was described by a first-order differential equation. The joint moments predicted by the dynamic solution were used as input to the static problems. In each static problem, the problem was to find the muscle activations which minimized the sum of muscle activations squared, and which generated the joint moments input from the dynamic solution. In the first static problem, muscles were treated as ideal force generators; in the second, they were constrained by their force\textendash length\textendash velocity properties; and in both, activation dynamics was neglected. In terms of predicted muscle forces and joint contact forces, the dynamic and static solutions were remarkably similar. Also, activation dynamics and the force\textendash length\textendash velocity properties of muscle had little influence on the static solutions. Thus, for normal gait, if one can accurately solve the inverse dynamics problem and if one seeks only to estimate muscle forces, the use of dynamic optimization rather than static optimization is currently not justified. Scenarios in which the use of dynamic optimization is justified are suggested.},

This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called ``visco-elasticity'' of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the ``visco-elastic'' properties of active muscle are shown to be a consequence of the properties described in Part II.},

In contrast, musculoskeletal modelling approaches use Inverse Kinematics (IK) to obtain joint angles. IK allows additional analysis (e.g. muscle-tendon length estimates), which may provide valuable information for clinical decision-making in people with movement disorders. The twofold aims of the current study were: (1) to compare joint kinematics obtained by a clinical DK model (Vicon Plug-in-Gait) with those produced by a widely used IK model (available with the OpenSim distribution), and (2) to evaluate the difference in joint kinematics that can be solely attributed to the different computational methods (DK versus IK), anatomical models and marker sets by using MRI based models. Eight children with cerebral palsy were recruited and presented for gait and MRI data collection sessions. Differences in joint kinematics up to 13\textdegree{} were found between the Plug-in-Gait and the gait 2392 OpenSim model. The majority of these differences (94.4\%) were attributed to differences in the anatomical models, which included different anatomical segment frames and joint constraints. Different computational methods (DK versus IK) were responsible for only 2.7\% of the differences. We recommend using the same anatomical model for kinematic and musculoskeletal analysis to ensure consistency between the obtained joint angles and musculoskeletal estimates.},

Matched musculoskeletal model and generic model in both systems were simulated using the external forces and joint kinematics measured at the Fourth and Sixth Grand Challenge Competitions to Predict In-Vivo Knee Loads. Muscle activation levels in lower limb were compared between the packages, and against the electromyography signals from the aforementioned competitions. The muscle activation levels were very similar between the two packages when matched models were simulated, indicating high consistency between the solvers. In the generic models, the root mean square (RMS) difference in the muscle activation levels was high at 0.15 and 0.19 for ideal force generator muscles and modified Hill-type muscles, respectively. The RMS and phase differences were high between the muscle activations and electromyography signals. Comparisons will help understand the similarities and differences between the musculoskeletal simulation packages and the effects of the model differences on simulation results.},

  abstract = {As the capability and utility of robots has increased dramatically with new technology, robotic systems can perform tasks that are physically dangerous for humans, repetitive in nature, or require increased accuracy, precision, and sterile conditions to radically minimize human error. The Robotics and Automation Handbook addresses the major aspects of designing, fabricating, and enabling robotic systems and their various applications. It presents kinetic and dynamic methods for analyzing robotic systems, considering factors such as force and torque. From these analyses, the book develops several controls approaches, including servo actuation, hybrid control, and trajectory planning. Design aspects include determining specifications for a robot, determining its configuration, and utilizing sensors and actuators. The featured applications focus on how the specific difficulties are overcome in the development of the robotic system. With the ability to increase human safety and precision in applications ranging from handling hazardous materials and exploring extreme environments to manufacturing and medicine, the uses for robots are growing steadily. The Robotics and Automation Handbook provides a solid foundation for engineers and scientists interested in designing, fabricating, or utilizing robotic systems.}

The system is general to non-human morphologies and results in natural balancing motions employing the entire body (for example, wind-milling). Our novel balance routine seeks to control the linear and angular momenta of the character. We demonstrate how momentum is related to the center of mass and center of pressure of the character and derive control rules to change these centers for balance. The desired momentum changes are reconciled with the objective of tracking the reference motion through an optimization routine which produces target joint accelerations. A hybrid inverse/forward dynamics algorithm determines joint torques based on these joint accelerations and the ground reaction forces. Finally, the joint torques are applied to the free-standing character simulation. We demonstrate results for following both motion capture and keyframe data as well as both human and non-human morphologies in presence of a variety of conditions and disturbances.},

Influence of different modelling assumptions and approaches on model outputs are still not fully understood, while direct comparisons of standard approaches have been rarely undertaken. This study seeks to compare joint kinematics, joint kinetics and estimated muscle forces of two standard approaches offered in two different modelling environments (AnyBody, OpenSim). It is hypothesised that distinctive differences exist for individual muscles, while summing up synergists show general agreement. Experimental data of 10 healthy participants (28 {$\pm$} 5 years, 1.72 {$\pm$} 0.08 m, 69 {$\pm$} 12 kg) was used for a standard static optimisation muscle force estimation routine in AnyBody and OpenSim while using two gait-specific musculoskeletal models. Statistical parameter mapping paired t-test was used to compare joint angle, moment and muscle force waveforms in Matlab. Results showed differences especially in sagittal ankle and hip angles as well as sagittal knee moments. Differences were also found for some of the muscles, especially of the triceps surae group and the biceps femoris short head, which occur as a result of different anthropometric and anatomical definitions (mass and inertia of segments, muscle properties) and scaling procedures (static vs. dynamic). Understanding these differences and their cause is crucial to operate such modelling environments in a clinical setting. Future research should focus on alternatives to classical generic musculoskeletal models (e.g. implementation of functional calibration tasks), while using experimental data reflecting normal and pathological gait to gain a better understanding of variations and divergent behaviour between approaches.},
